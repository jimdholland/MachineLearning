Coursera Machine Learning Project
========================================================

This is my course project.

```{r}
library(caret)

rm(list = ls())

fitbit <- read.csv("C:/Users/James/Google Drive/Courserea/MachineLearning/Project/pml-training.csv", header=T)
```

I decided to drop variables that seemed extraneous and any predictive power would just be actually be random noise.
```{r}
#----drop what don't seem to be possible to be predictors.
vartodrop <- c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_windown")
fitbit <- fitbit[, !names(fitbit) %in% vartodrop] 
```

Here I set the seed and went with a random forest model.
```{r}
set.seed(1771)


inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=fitbit$classe, p=.7, list=F)

training <- fitbit[inTrain,]
testing <- fitbit[-inTrain,]

modFit <- train(classe ~., data=training, method="rf", prox=T)

modFit
```
